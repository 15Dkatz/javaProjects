Please run the Driver.class with an argument of whatever text file you want (given example...) in order to see the code in action.

This lab specifically called for us to implement our own custom hashMaps to count the words of long text files. I found it cool implementing 
my own hashCode method, and use that returned number to determine which LinkedList to sort each respective word into. One of the most
challenging hurdles came in keeping the list sorted as I added in words. This sorting method involved counting identical words
but also maintaining the integrity of the LinkedList. As a result of many trials however, I completed the code necessary
for printing the sorted list of counted words.

I used the AliceInWonderLand.txt file from Project Gutenberg, so you can use that to test the code. However, you can also just import
any textFile you desire to count the words in that one. Some interesting ones: the Bible, Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter.

Thanks,
David
