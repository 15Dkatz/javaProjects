Part 1:
I enjoyed explored LinkedLists in java. I had a difficult time implementing the structure at first, because I initially coded an insertion method that assumed a singly linked list, but a print method that assumed a doubly linked list. I eventually figured this out though, and fixed my insertion method and then coding became painless from then on.

Notes:
My Node's compareTo method sorts according to key. ***
Since my search method uses contains, it will actually find all instances with the contained searchString. Because of this, it can also search by substring rather than having to search with the entire userId. ***
Depending on the "commonality" search query the printList method will take a few seconds or more to execute, so please give it time to complete. 

Part 2:
I had a lot of fun implementing the Twitter API in my java project. Having something tangible and professionally developed to play with definitely makes this project all-the-more valuable. Surprisingly, I did not have many challenges implementing the code. I can't wait to utilize more APIs and of course discover more awesome things about twitter's API.

Thanks,
David
